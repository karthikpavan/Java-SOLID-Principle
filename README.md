Java SOLID Principle
--------------------------------

SOLID Principle are used to reduce the dependencies.

SOLID Principle are intended to make design easier to understand, maintain & extend.

SOLID Principle helps to lead the code for better readability, maintainability, design pattern & testablity.

Types:

1. Single Responsibility

2. Open/Closed

3. Liskov Substitution

4. Interface Segeration

5. Dependency Inversion

 #Single Responsibility# : It States that one Class should have one & only one responsibility, where we should write, change & maintain a class  only for one purpose.
 -----------------------
 
 #Open/Closed# : It States that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification
                 (means we can extend and include extra functionality in our code without altering existing implementation)
 -----------------------
 
#Liskov Substitution# : It states that software component should not alter the desirable result when we replace a parent type with any of the subtype, 
                        or we can say that Derived type must be completely substitutable for their base types.
 -----------------------
 
#Interface Segeration# : It states that client should not be forced to implement un-necessary methods which they will not use.
 -----------------------
 
 #Dependency Inversion# : It states that "Depends on abstraction, not on concretions"
						              (means we should design our software in such a way that various modules can be seperated from each other using an abstract layer to bind them together)
